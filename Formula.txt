This is the Formula for 'Secure Roblox Pipe Connection C++ and C# sided'.

When Injected (with C++) version, the DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH will run a function (most likely void or static void), defined also as 1 or 2, while running, it will show a console (GetConsoleWindow() with SW_SHOW, TOPMOST), and display text to inform the user that console has loaded. The pipe will create and be connected ONLY if the user has pasted the 'Secure Pipe Connection' code. If the user has no working exploit dll source, it will only be created, but cannot send strings to pipe and modify bytes, string, etc. When pipe is created, it will automatically generate a random pipe name(str), (THIS PART HAS BEEN HIDDEN), When it reads, it will replace the C# in-built string(s) to the pipe. But note that when Injected, someone can access the pipe ONLY if they find the pipe. The only way to find the pipe is: \\\\.\\pipe\\ while this method is one of the many.
