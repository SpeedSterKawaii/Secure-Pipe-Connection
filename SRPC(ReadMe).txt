Thank you for purchasing "Secure Roblox Pipe Connection" (SRPC) for Custom Roblox C++/C# Exploit DLL's.
Please take time to review this file, as it contains important documents for the SRPC, policy, restrictions, payments, etc.

#*# WHAT DID YOU PURCHASE? #*#

You purchased "Secure Roblox Pipe Connection" for $10! (dll src is $5, api src is $3, and tax is $2). If you purchased something else, there is no refunds, please take time and see what you purchased. Once you keep the source, it is yours. Money/cards/payment types are probably already used. This is not fraud, or any acts of fraud.

#&# WHAT IS THIS 'SRPC'? #&#

"Secure Roblox Pipe Connection", can help you hide your exploit pipe in real time! (If you didn't know already, pipe is a way to execute scripts with buffer, memory, etc via strings, characters and bytecode). In short (SRPC), is a powerful pipe hiding method developed by Speed Softwares (owned by SSK), that can randomize your pipe string/name, every injection! You will NOT have the same pipe every injection, synapseX uses a similar method for this. This literally hides script kiddies from skidding!

#!# HOW TO USE THIS? #!#

Step 1: Open the Visual Studio Project File (.sln) called "SRPC (By Speed Softwares).sln".
Step 2: Copy the c++ [or] header files or .cpp file, and paste into your own c++ exploit dll source.
Step 3: Every Instruction is Already Included with //comments!
Step 4: Compile up your .dll file and your ready to stop script kiddies!

#%# DISCLAIMERS/NOTES: #%#

Roblox Exploit C++ DLL Source is not Included.
This randoms your pipe every injection, old pipe won't work.
You must have a external c# ui with dll injection code.
You must implement this yourself, this is not made for newbies.
