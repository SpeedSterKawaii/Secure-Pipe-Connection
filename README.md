# Secure-Pipe-Connection!

I'm tired of skids attempting to skid my pipe, so I developed this. A secure way of scaring off pipe skidders.

***Pipe changes every injection - remember this.***

**Please read Information.txt as it has all of the information you may ask for.**

# Payment!
This is **not a free service.** The **fee** is $5 - $10, cannot be **negotiated**.

**Accepting PlayStation, ROBLOX, Amazon or any Gift Card that is Worth more then $5.**

**No PayPal, Credit Card, Cashapp, Venmo, or any of these types are accepted.**

***Message me on Discord: SpeedSterKawaii#7758, for Backup: speedsterscripts@gmail.com!***

```There is no returns, once you purchase it, it cannot be returned.```

# Notes!
Only for **ROBLOX Exploits** and **Custom C++/C# API's or DLL's!**

Only on Windows 10, Works with Any Visual Studio Edition (2015-2022).

**Every Injection, A new pipe will be generated, Old pipe will not be used.**

**People may access (or use) your pipe after 1 injection, but that's idiotic.**

Edit: I've leaked the method, but it'll cost you.

# What is Included!

DLL only ($5) + Tax ($2) + API ($3).

**You will NOT get the dll source, in order to get the dll source the price will increase by 3% which is $18 worth in gift cards.**
